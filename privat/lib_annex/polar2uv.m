function [u,v] = polar2uv(dir,spd)

%  polar2uv:  (east, north) currents of direction and speed
%
%       u is eastward current component
%       v is northward current component
%       dir is compass direction of current
%             (90 for eastward flow, 270 for westward)
%       spd is magnitude of current
